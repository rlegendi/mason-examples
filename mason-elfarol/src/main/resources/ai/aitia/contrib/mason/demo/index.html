<h1>El Farol</h1>

<p>El Farol is a bar in Santa Fe, New Mexico. The bar is popular ---
	especially on Thursday nights when they offer Irish music --- but
	sometimes becomes overcrowded and unpleasant. In fact, if the patrons
	of the bar think it will be overcrowded they stay home; otherwise they
	go enjoy themselves at El Farol. This model explores what happens to
	the overall attendance at the bar on these popular Thursday evenings,
	as the patrons use different strategies for determining how crowded
	they think the bar will be.</p>

<p>The implementation was based on the NetLogo Model Library.</p>
